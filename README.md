# E-Prescribing-System
Doctors will log onto the system to create medication prescriptions for patients. When adding medication onto the prescription the system will automatically check for contra-indications related to any conditions the patient may have, as well as for interactions with medication previously prescribed to the patient. The prescription will be stored online and the patient may then go to any pharmacy in order to fill the prescription by giving his ID number to the pharmacist. The pharmacist will log onto the system to pull the prescription and dispense the medication.
